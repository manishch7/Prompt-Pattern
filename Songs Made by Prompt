## 🎼 Lyrics: **"Link by Link, Think by Think"**  

Professor Brown, gather ‘round,
Here’s a tune that’s logic-bound.
It’s all about the Chain of Thought,
A step-by-step approach we’re taught.

Got a problem? Don’t you rush,
Take it slow—no need to crush.
Start with facts, then ask what’s true,
Piece by piece, the clues come through.

Let’s say there’s cake and plates to stack,
How many fit? Now don’t look back!
Measure the plates, and count the cake,
Step by step is the move to make.

Each small piece will light the way,
Bit by bit, the answer’ll stay.
No guessing games, no mental fog,
We follow the chain—it’s like a jog!

So sing this tune when you’re stuck and blue,
Logic’s the song that pulls you through.
Professor Brown, here’s the thought:
We’ll always love the Chain of Thought!

Step by step, the path is clear,
Logic will guide us—never fear!
Link by link, it won’t go wrong,
So sing it loud, and sing it long!
